# Virtual-Dance-Pad
A-Level Computing Project. Virtual Dance Pad for Stepmania.

The aim of this project is to create a piece of software which creates a Virtual Dance Pad allowing the user to play Stepmania without having to own a physical dance pad.
This is to be done using a single webcam.

This is in no way a replacement for physical dance pads. The latency will be significantly worse, potentially unplayable depending on hardware. The program may not even be able to detect players' feet.
